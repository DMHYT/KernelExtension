CHANGELOG

RELEASE 1.0 (EARLY ALPHA)
- Item.createFoodItem method patch to specify lots of new params (all listed in declarations)
- ToolAPI module fully rewritten to native code and vanilla tool classes. You can still use ToolAPI to register tools, but in order not to make KEX use a little crutch many times, consider using ToolsModule.register[Sword/Axe/Pickaxe/Shovel/Hoe/CustomTool] or Item.create[([Sword/Axe/Pickaxe/Shovel/Hoe]Item)/CustomTool] (instead of normal Item.createItem).
    - ToolAPI.ToolParams interface now has new method int getAttackDamageBonus(ItemInstance item), to override default damage to be applied to item depending on the stack contents (example of use: Nano Saber from IC2)
- ItemsModule with 8 new methods for items (will increase in future updates)
- LootModule to modify vanilla loot tables (dungeon chests, entities drops and fishing loot, NOT trading)
- Actor, Mob, Slime, MobEffect, MobEffectInstance API (experimental, not tested)

BETA 1.1
- Small fix in Item.createFoodItem patch
- Fixed all errors called by tools logics
- Restructured and refactored LootModule

BETA 1.2
- Added methods to the LootModifier class: addJSModifyCallback, addJSONModifyCallback, addJSPostModifyCallback, addJSONPostModifyCallback.
    - The first pair is used to change the JSON object of the loot table directly after all programmatical modifications.
    - The other pair is used to work with the JSON object of the loot table after all types of modifications. In these callbacks all the provided objects are copies and shouldn't be modified.
- Added method LootModule.addPiglinBarteringItem to add new items to the piglin bartering list. This method takes no parameters and returns LootEntry interface.
- Added function getKEXVersion(), returns array containing three integers of the current mod version (now it's [1, 2, 0]).

BETA 1.3
- AddonUtils class is now exported by the shared API.
- Added function getKEXVersionCode(), which can be used for more convenient version checks.
- Added callback "KEX-InnerCoreIdsCached", provides no parameters.
- Fixed LootModifier methods addJSModifyCallback, addJSPostModifyCallback crashing.
